README

This sample program is a I2S to PWM sound converter. It receives I2S sound data
(2 channels with 32 bit width and 24 bit signed audio samples) via the I2S
interface exposed on the 40 pin GPIO header. The sound data will be converted to
PWM signals and you can listen to it on the 3.5" headphone jack.

For a simple test two Raspberry Pi computers can be used. Install
sample/34-sounddevices on the transmitting computer and create a file
cmdline.txt on the SD card with this contents:

	soundev=sndi2s

Install this sample program on the receiving computer and connect a headphone to
the 3.5" headphone jack.

Both computers have to be connected via the 40 pin GPIO header this way (GPIO
numbers are chip numbers, not header positions):

	Transmitter		Receiver
	GPIO			GPIO

	18 (CLK)	-->	18 (CLK)
	19 (FS)		-->	19 (FS)
	21 (DOUT)	-->	20 (DIN)
	GND		<-->	GND

The configured SAMPLE_RATE (default 44100) in the file config.h of both sample
programs must match, but can be modified.

After powering on both computers and completed boot a modulated 440 Hz tone can
be heard on both channels of the headphone.
